# VERI Part 1

## .bsf and .bdf

We find out that the link between .bsf and .bdf are bidirectional, we could include only the .bsf or the .bdf, and the code will still 'Analysis	and	Elaboration'. But we were suggested by the UTA to include .bdf as that's how normally done.

What is the difference between SLOW 0 and 85 celcius propagation delay?
According to Brownian motion, electrons move faster when the temperature is high. This results in collison between molecules, and therefore the delay time between gates rises.
